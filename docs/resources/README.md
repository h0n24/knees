# Project Resources

Centralized references for design, requirements, and wireframes to keep the team aligned.

- `requirements/`
  - `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md` — condensed functional and UX requirements from the README and creative brief.
  - `CREATIVE-BRIEF.md` — copy of the creative/design brief for quick access.
- `wireframes/`
  - Desktop, mobile, and trainer/admin wireframe PDFs relocated here for convenience.

Use this folder as the single place to grab context before designing or building new features.
