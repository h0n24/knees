Keeping the bottom leg straight, lift the bottom leg upward 6\u20138 inches off the floor. You will feel the inner thigh (adductors) of the bottom leg contract. Slowly lower it back down and repeat. This exercise strengthens the hip adductors (inner thigh muscles), which contribute to knee stability and alignment. Strong adductors also support better balance and can help prevent excessive lateral movement of the knee. As you get stronger, you can add an ankle weight or increase reps (AAOS recommends up to 3 sets of 20 for adduction)."

Then switch legs. For added challenge, try doing it without holding on, or on a slightly unstable surface (like a folded towel) once basic balance is good. Balance exercises like this strengthen the small stabilizer muscles around the knee and ankle and improve proprioception. Better balance can translate to fewer knee injuries from missteps. If 30 seconds is easy, you can progress to gentle movements while balancing (e.g. moving your arms or closing your eyes for short intervals)."

Repeat for high reps (you should feel a burn along the shins by ~15+ reps ). Tibialis anterior strength is often overlooked but is important for decelerating the foot and reducing impact on the knees when walking or running. Strong tibialis muscles can absorb force and take load off the knee joints. As you get stronger, you can make it harder by stepping further from the wall (increasing the angle) or eventually doing this exercise on one leg. Aim for about 20\u201325 reps; if you fatigue around 15, that\u2019s normal \u2013 try to build up to the higher reps over time Sources: These exercises and guidelines are drawn from orthopedic and physical therapy resources, including the AAOS Knee Conditioning Program, arthritis foundations, and expert- reviewed fitness articles. Always perform exercises with good form and within a pain-free range. Consistency is key \u2013 doing these movements regularly (e.g. daily or 4\u20135 times a week) can help build strength and flexibility around the knee. If an exercise exacerbates pain, skip it or modify it, and consider consulting a physical therapist for personalized modifications. With time and proper progression, these exercises can improve knee stability, reduce pain, and enhance overall lower- limb function"
